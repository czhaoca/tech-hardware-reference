# Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ Performance Optimization

This folder contains notes, commands, and setup guides aimed at improving the performance of the Samsung Galaxy A9+ tablet. The primary goal is to optimize the device by removing preinstalled packages and applications that consume system resources on the carrier-branded OS.

## Background

The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet, with **4GB of RAM**, can experience performance issues with the default **carrier-branded One UI**, as it often takes too long to load and operate smoothly. Given the device's limited hardware resources, improving performance by reducing bloatware is critical.

- **Problem**: AOSP, third-party ROMs, and international versions of Samsung's official firmware are not readily available for this device.
- **Solution**: The best available approach is to optimize the current system by uninstalling or disabling preinstalled packages and services that are not necessary for the device's daily use.

## Purpose

This project focuses on using **ADB** to identify and remove unnecessary system apps and packages to free up memory and improve overall performance. The primary objective is to make the device more responsive by reducing the resource consumption from bloatware and unused apps.

## Files in This Folder

- **`adb_commands.md`**: A collection of useful ADB commands for managing packages on the device.
- **`uninstalled_apps.md`**: A detailed list of apps and packages that have been uninstalled to free up resources, along with the ADB commands used.
- **`setup.md`**: A general setup guide for enabling ADB, including how to install ADB platform tools without the need for Android Studio, and tips for setting up the device for optimization.

## Instructions

1. **Follow the setup guide** (`setup.md`) to install ADB tools and enable developer options on your Galaxy A9+ tablet.
2. Use the commands in **`adb_commands.md`** to manage system apps on the device.
3. Refer to **`uninstalled_apps.md`** for the specific list of apps that have been removed to improve performance.

## Notes

- Always make sure to **back up your device** before making any significant changes, such as uninstalling system apps.
- This method is tailored for users who want to maintain the stock firmware while optimizing performance without having to switch to custom ROMs or firmware that may not be available for the Galaxy A9+.

With this approach, you should notice improved performance, faster app load times, and better system responsiveness on your Galaxy Tab A9+.
